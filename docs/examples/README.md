# Annotated examples

In this part of the documentation we provide working examples that are annotated
with explanations / tutorial-style snippets, which helps break down some of the
more complex examples in a more easy-to-digest form.

A great format for consuming knowledge like this is the Jupyter Python notebooks.
For a compiled language such as C++, attempts to "notebook-ify" come with limitations.
Therefore we go for a simpler option: We annotate working code with special comment
blocks, and then translate the code (with these comments)
into a markdown page of interleaving text (normal)
and code blocks. We do this while attempting to keep the code structure in a way that it is
intended to be read linearly, from the top to bottom, in a flat hierarchy as much as
possible.

Of course this results in a static markdown page as a result, so we cannot execute
the individual code blocks like in a Python notebook, however the actual working
example can always be compiled and run.
